<h3> What is Fair Squares </h3>


Fair Squares is committed to let the number of affordable rental houses grow, motivated by the unfair lack of adequate housing. This urgent societal problem we face impacts a huge number of people, also in the European Union.  

The financing costs and also the profits of rental housing can be quite high resulting in rental housing being too expensive. We started in 2021 with the question if organizational technology such as blockchain could help solve one of the main reasons behind the lack of affordable housing. Our hypothesis is that the combination of the further concentration of meanings privatizing social housing structures and rising construction costs are the main reasons for the growth of rental prices and so more housing costs are overburdened in Europe. 

The FS housing operating and financing system is designed and built via public, open source software to enable crowd-capital as a social instrument. The intention is to organize and finance housing more effectively, with less friction, administration and more transparency to achieve lower, more affordable rental prices of houses.  
Instead of a normal landlord or developer putting up all the money, social impact investors within the Fair Squares community will fund projects in exchange for fractional ownership generating a low-risk return that is comparable with other risk-off assets like bonds. Initially, Fair Square will focus on crowdfunding the purchase of residential real estate and in later stages may progress to development or sustainable renovation projects.
